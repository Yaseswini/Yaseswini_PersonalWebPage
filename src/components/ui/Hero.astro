    I am currently volunteering as a web page developer for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13074137/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue; font-style: italic;">Boston-area Women in Bioinformatics</a>, contributing to the development of their online presence.

    When I am not diving into the data, I enjoy hiking with my family, tending to my garden, photography, and tapping into my creative side by painting mandalas!
